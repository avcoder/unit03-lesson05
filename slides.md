# Exercise1 : Routing
(30 min) Refer to [last class slides](https://unit03-lesson04.netlify.app/presenter/2)

```js
1. create a new folder and go into it via `cd folder`
2. Type `npm init -y`
3. `npm install express` // where in package.json is express placed?
4. `npm install nodemon --save-dev` // what does --save-dev do? where in package.json is nodemon placed?
5. create an index.js file with the following code:
```
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Mock data for food truck orders
let orders = [
  { id: 1, item: 'Taco', quantity: 2, customer: 'Alice' },
  { id: 2, item: 'Burger', quantity: 1, customer: 'Bob' },
];

app.get('/orders', (req, res) => { res.json(orders) });
app.listen(3000, () => { console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000') });
```
```js
6. make it so you run the app via `npm start` and it uses nodemon
7. Move the port number in .env 
```

# Exercise 1 continued: Routing

```js
// 8. Create a new route that gives us a single order by ID
app.get('/orders/:id', (req, res) => { // What does the : followed by any name do?
  // 9. Fill in the ??? below so that we get the value of :id. Hint: console.log(req.params)
  const orderId = parseInt(???); // What does parseInt do?

  // 10. Fill in the ??? below such that "order" will have the object where its id equals orderId
  const order = orders.find(???); // What does the array method .find do? See 

  // 11. Fill in the ??? below that gives us a truthy value if the above order was found
  if (???) {
    res.json(order);
  } else {
    res.status(404).json({ error: 'Order not found' });
  }
});
```

# Exercise 1 continued

Discuss:
- What steps does the server take from the moment a GET /orders/:id request is received to when it sends a response?  Walk through the flow, including route matching, parsing the ID, and sending the result?
- What would the response look like if an order is found vs. not found?  Describe both the JSON structure and the HTTP status codes involved?
- What data type is req.params.id, and why do we use parseInt() on it?  What would happen if we skipped parsing it, and how would that affect the lookup?

# Exercise 2: Query Strings and Parameters
(50 min) Extract query strings and parameters from a url

- Add a new route: GET /orders/search?customer=Alice
- This should return all orders made by the customer named Alice.

```js
// 1. Adjust our array to include one more order from Alice
let orders = [
  { id: 1, item: 'Taco', quantity: 2, customer: 'Alice' },
  { id: 2, item: 'Burger', quantity: 1, customer: 'Bob' },
  { id: 3, item: 'Nachos', quantity: 1, customer: 'Alice' },
];
```

# Exercise 2 continued: Query Strings and Params

```js
// 2. Fill in the ??? below to properly add the route
app.???('/orders/search', (req, res) => {
  // 3. Fill in the ??? so that if GET request is /orders/search?customer=Alice, then the variable customer will contain the value of "Alice". Hint: try console.log(req.query)
  const { ??? } = ???; // Review: here we are object destructuring to get customer
  let filteredOrders = [];

  // 4. Fill in the ??? such that the conditional is truthy if a customer is found
  if (???) {
    // 5. Fill in the ??? such that we only get Alice's/alice's orders
    filteredOrders = ???
  }

  res.json(filteredOrders);
});
// 6. Refactor code to also include query param item such that
//  if there is a GET /orders/search?customer=alice&item=taco
//  or if there is a GET /orders/search?item=taco&customer=alice
//  then either way it'll return { id: 1, item: 'Taco', quantity: 2, customer: 'Alice' }
```

# Exercise 2 continued

Discuss:
- What is the difference between route parameters (/orders/:id) and query parameters (/orders/search?customer=Alice)?  When and why would you use one over the other?
- How might you modify the /orders/search route to allow partial matches (e.g., search for ‚ÄúAli‚Äù to get ‚ÄúAlice‚Äù)?
- How might you handle pagination in the /orders/search route? ex: ?page=2&limit=10, and how would that change the response structure?

# Exercise 3: POST
(50 min) Review https://unit03-lesson02.netlify.app/12

- Add a new route: POST /orders; this should add a new order 
- Request's body should contain the new data for the order (item, quantity, customer)

```js
// 1. Fill in the ??? to add the POST route
app.???('/orders', (req, res) => {
  const { item, quantity, customer } = req.body;

  const newOrder = {
    id: ???, // 2. Fill in the ??? such that we set the next sequential id number
    item,
    quantity,
    customer,
  };
  
  // 3. Fill in the ??? such that orders should have a list of all the orders including the newest one
  orders???

  // 4. Fill ??? to be a status code signifying the request succeeded and a new resource was created
  res.status(???).json(newOrder);
});
```

# Exercise 3 continued

Discuss:
- What HTTP method is used to create a new order, and why is it appropriate here?  Why not use GET instead?
- Where does the server get the new order data from in the request?
- How could you validate the incoming request data to make sure it's complete and valid?
What would happen if a user sends a request without item, quantity, or customer?

# Exercise 4: PUT 

- Add a new route: PUT /orders; this should update an order by id 
- Request's body should contain the new data for the order (item, quantity, customer)

```js
app.put('/orders/:id', (req, res) => {
  const orderId = parseInt(req.params.id);
  const { item, quantity, customer } = req.body;
  const index = orders.findIndex((o) => o.id === orderId);

  if (index !== -1) { // My font ligature makes the "not equals" operator look like that in the slides
    orders[index] = { id: orderId, item, quantity, customer };
    res.json(orders[index]);
  } else {
    res.status(404).json({ error: 'Order not found' });
  }
});
```

# Exercise 4 continued

Discuss:
- What is the purpose of the PUT method in this route and how is it different from a POST?
- Why did we use findIndex() instead of find() when updating?  (i.e. What do we need that find() doesn‚Äôt give us?)
- How can you validate the data before updating? What if someone tries to update an order with quantity: "hello"?

# Exercise 4 continued: DELETE

- Add a new route: Delete /orders/:id should delete an order by id 

```js
app.delete('/orders/:id', (req, res) => {
  const orderId = parseInt(req.params.id);
  const index = orders.findIndex((o) => o.id === orderId);

  if (index !== -1) {
    orders.splice(index, 1);
    res.sendStatus(204); // What does status 204 mean?
  } else {
    res.status(404).json({ error: 'Order not found' });
  }
});
```
- Test with POSTMAN to ensure it works

---
transition: slide-left

# Exercise 4 continued

Discuss:
- How does the server know which order to delete?
- Should anyone be allowed to delete an order?
- What are "soft deletes", why would you use it and how would you implement it?
